## MVP Scope & Acceptance Criteria

- Core tools (web): Merge, Split, Compress, PDF ↔ Word conversion, PDF to JPG, JPG to PDF, Rotate, Protect/Unlock.
- Authentication and user accounts (email + OAuth), basic subscription (Free/Premium), Stripe integration for payments.
- File storage on S3 with signed URLs, PostgreSQL for metadata, and server-side PDF processing via Node.js microservices.
- Basic UI (responsive) built with Next.js + Tailwind; accessible flows for uploading, processing, and downloading files.
- Admin dashboard with usage metrics and user management.

Acceptance criteria (MVP):
- A user can register, upload up to 20MB, and run Merge or Compress successfully with a processed downloadable file.
- Stripe subscription creates/updates user plan and enforces limits.
- System logs errors to Sentry and stores audit events for each file operation.

---

## Technical Architecture (high level)

- Next.js (App Router) for frontend and server-side API routes for light-weight logic and authentication.
- Dedicated Node.js workers (containerized) for CPU-bound PDF processing tasks (pdf-lib, poppler utils, or headless LibreOffice for conversions).
- A job queue (BullMQ with Redis) to schedule and scale processing tasks, allowing retries and priority.
- Storage: AWS S3 for files + Glacier for long-term archives; metadata in PostgreSQL (managed RDS).
- AI/OCR: Tesseract or AWS Textract for OCR in initial phase; later migrate heavy workloads to an ML microservice using GPU instances as needed.
- CDN (CloudFront) for serving static assets and processed results.

Data flow (simplified):
1. User uploads file to a signed S3 URL.
2. Upload event enqueues a job in Redis/BullMQ.
3. Worker pulls job, processes file, writes result to S3, updates DB, sends notification via WebSocket or email.

## Infrastructure & Detailed Cost Breakdown (estimates)

Startup / monthly sample costs (first 12 months, US region):
- VMs / containers (workers + API): $1,500/mo
- Managed Postgres (RDS): $300/mo
- Redis (ElastiCache): $150/mo
- S3 storage + requests + bandwidth: $400/mo (scales with usage)
- OCR / AI API spend (OpenAI / Textract): $300/mo (variable)
- Monitoring & Logging (Sentry, Datadog): $200/mo
- CDN (CloudFront): $100/mo
- Misc (backups, DNS, certs): $50/mo

Estimated monthly run-rate (initial): ~$3,000/mo. See Year 1 line items in Cost Estimate for team and go-to-market.

---

## Security, Privacy & Compliance

- Encrypt files at rest (S3 SSE) and in transit (TLS). Use server-side or client-side encryption for sensitive plans.
- Role-based access control and least privilege for internal services.
- Audit logs for all file operations and admin actions.
- GDPR and CCPA readiness: data deletion, export, and privacy policy.
- Consider ISO27001 / SOC2 readiness for enterprise customers (timeline after product-market fit).

---

## Team & Roles (initial)

- Product Manager (1) — roadmap, requirements, GTM.
- Full-stack Engineers (2-3) — Next.js, API, integrations.
- Backend Engineers (1-2) — workers, queue, infra, scaling.
- DevOps / SRE (1, part-time) — CI/CD, monitoring, infra automation.
- Designer / Frontend (1) — UX flows, branding.
- QA / Test Engineer (1, part-time) — e2e tests, quality gates.

---

## Milestones & Deliverables (detailed)

Phase 0 — Prep (2 weeks)
- Finalize requirements, product spec, acceptance criteria.
- Create project repo, CI templates, initial infra IaC (Terraform simple setup).

Phase 1 — MVP (Months 1-3)
- Implement auth, billing, storage, and 3 core tools (Merge, Compress, Convert PDF→Word).
- End-to-end tests, basic observability, and admin dashboard.

Phase 2 — Beta & Integrations (Months 4-6)
- Add OCR, Sign, Watermark, Drive/Dropbox integrations, and improve UX.
- Customer beta with selected partners and onboarding docs.

Phase 3 — Scale & Advanced Features (Months 7-12)
- Implement workflows, API access, enterprise features, advanced AI (document analysis, redaction), and compliance work.

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigations

- Risk: Heavy CPU usage and high cloud costs for conversions. Mitigation: queueing, autoscaling, ephemeral worker pools, caching common conversions.
- Risk: Legal/compliance exposure for storing user documents. Mitigation: clear retention policy, optional client-side encryption, and robust TOS/privacy.
- Risk: Accuracy of conversions/OCR. Mitigation: progressive enhancement—offer best-effort free tier and higher-quality paid tier with advanced OCR.

---

## Success Metrics & KPIs

- Activation: % of signup -> first successful PDF operation (target 40% within 7 days).
- Retention: 30-day active users for free tier and conversion to paid (target 5–10% conversion in 90 days).
- Processing throughput: average jobs/sec and 95th percentile latency under load.
- Error rate: failed jobs <1%.
- ARPU and MRR growth month-over-month.

---

## Next Steps (immediate actions)

1. Review and approve the updated proposal and MVP acceptance criteria.
2. Create the project repo with a starter Next.js template and basic CI (GitHub Actions).
3. Provision staging infra (S3, Postgres, Redis) and connect a minimal worker to process a sample Merge job.

---

If this looks good, I can: (a) create an initial GitHub repo layout and `package.json` + Next.js starter files, (b) scaffold CI and basic IaC, and (c) add a README with getting-started steps. Tell me which of those to do first and I'll implement it.
